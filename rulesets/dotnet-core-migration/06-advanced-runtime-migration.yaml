    System.EnterpriseServices (COM+) is not available in .NET Core and has no direct replacement.
    This namespace provided enterprise-level service configuration including transactions, object pooling, and role-based security.

    Migration actions:
    - Remove dependencies on System.EnterpriseServices
    - Replace ServicedComponent base class with alternative patterns
    - Use database transactions instead of distributed transactions where possible
    - Implement object pooling using ObjectPool<T> from Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool
    - Replace role-based security with ASP.NET Core authorization policies
    - Consider redesigning architecture to use modern patterns (microservices, containers)
    - For distributed transactions on Windows, evaluate System.Transactions.Local package (limited support)

    System.Drawing.Common is available in .NET Core but only supported on Windows as of .NET 6.
    For cross-platform applications, use alternative imaging libraries.

    Migration actions:
    - For cross-platform: Replace with ImageSharp (SixLabors.ImageSharp) or SkiaSharp
    - ImageSharp is recommended for image processing (resize, crop, format conversion)
    - SkiaSharp is recommended for 2D graphics and drawing operations
    - System.Drawing.Primitives (Point, Size, Rectangle, Color) remain cross-platform
    - If Windows-only: Can continue using System.Drawing.Common with understanding of limitations

    Common migrations:
    - Image loading/saving: Use ImageSharp.Image.Load() and Save()
    - Image manipulation: Use ImageSharp mutate operations
    - Drawing/graphics: Use SkiaSharp.SKCanvas
    - Review all System.Drawing usage except Primitives namespace

    System.Windows.Forms is available in .NET Core but is Windows-only.
    For cross-platform desktop applications, consider modern alternatives.

    Migration options:

    Option 1 - Keep Windows Forms (Windows-only):
    - Windows Forms is supported in .NET 6+ but Windows-only
    - Use for Windows-specific applications
    - Requires Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WindowsDesktop SDK
    - Set <UseWindowsForms>true</UseWindowsForms> in project file

    Option 2 - Avalonia UI (Recommended for cross-platform):
    - Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS, mobile, web)
    - XAML-based similar to WPF
    - Active community and good documentation
    - Can reuse some WPF knowledge

    Option 3 - .NET MAUI:
    - Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android)
    - Modern Microsoft framework
    - Good for mobile-first applications
    - Single codebase for desktop and mobile

    Option 4 - Blazor Hybrid:
    - Use web technologies (HTML/CSS) with native container
    - Cross-platform
    - Reuse web development skills

    Migration actions:
    - If targeting only Windows: Continue using Windows Forms
    - If targeting cross-platform: Plan migration to Avalonia or MAUI
    - This is a significant rewrite for cross-platform scenarios
    - Consider application requirements and target platforms
